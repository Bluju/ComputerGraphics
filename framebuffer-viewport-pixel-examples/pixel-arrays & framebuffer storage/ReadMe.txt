The example programs
   FrameBufferImplementations.java
   PixelArrays.java
   ViewportInFramebufferSimulation.java
are meant to be used with the "Java Visualizer" web site. These
programs do not use the framebuffer package. Instead, they "simulate"
very simplified definitions of the FrameBuffer and Viewport classes.
The simplified definitions make it easier to understand the more
complex implementations used in the framebuffer package. Also
