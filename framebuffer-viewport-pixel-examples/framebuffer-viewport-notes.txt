read the section in readme.txt in renderer1 about framebuffer and viewport

because viewports have their own coordinate system, it allows your data to be position independent.
If you need to move an image on your screen, can just change the position of the viewport

to get transparency in images, need to 'blend' the images
take the average of the front image color and the rear image color (60% front, 40% back)

Dont read directly from the file, let the framebuffer class read the data from another framebuffer,
then copy data from framebuffer into the viewport

The squares are 100px by 100px

for the diagonal shift by 1

for the circles use the equation (x-x0)^2 + (y-y0)^2
